                        Immediately after the Big Bang, and before the universe became just 10<sup>-43</sup> seconds old,
						the Planck Era represented a time when the four fundamental forces were united. 
						<br> These forces are the electromagnetic force (governs behavior of lights and magnets), gravity (governs interactions between masses),
						<br> the strong force (binds protons and neutrons together), and the weak force (important for nuclear reactions through fusion, and fission)
                        <br> In this tiny fraction of a second, temperature and pressure must have been above 10^32 Kelvin. </b>

							Following the Planck Era, the GUT period is marked by two forces: first, gravity, and, second, the GUT force, 
							<br> which is the combined the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. If GUT theories are correct, 
							<br> rapid inflation in space occured as well as the separation of the strong and weak forces. 
							<br> There must have been a hypothetical X and Y Bosons allowing for proton decay. 
							This period lasted for 10<sup>-43</sup> to 10<sup>-38</sup> seconds.

						<b>Electroweak Era
						<br>With gravity and the strong forces separated, the electromagnetic and weak forces were still together. 
						<br>Due to matter and antimatter being annihilated, all that exists is the byproducts: photons and pure energy.
						<br>The temperature cools to 10<sup>15</sup> Kelvin;
						<br>By 10<sup>-10</sup> seconds, the electroweak forces separate, causing the distinct four fundamental forces to be found.

						<br>There are slightly more particles than antiparticles, allowing matter to be sustained and existence today.

						<b>Era of Nuclei
						<br>Hydrogen, helium, and free electrons compose the universe for the next 380,000 years as it expands and cools; 
						<br>it is a hot plasma that fails to form galaxies or other large structures.
						<br>Protons and neutrons spared from annihilation form heavier nuclei. This process is called "recombination",
						<br>whereby neutral hydrogen atoms are created. Reducing energy, these atoms reach their ground state by "decoupling" from their photons. 
						<br>Alongside this, the universe cools until 10<sup>9</sup> Kelvin, in which case fusion of new nuclei ends.
						<br>The decoupled photons can be found as evidence in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. For the first time, the universe is clear!

						<b>Era of Atoms
